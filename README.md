# Geo Data Science with Python, Fall 2021

## Submitting homework

To submit homework, you need to use 4 commands (ok, really 3, but the first one is a good habit). Execute all of them, each time you make changes to your home work:
```
git pull
## assuming your homwork was saved as HW1_pid.ipynb
git add HW1_pid.ipynb
git commit -m "HW1 submitted!!"
git push
```
